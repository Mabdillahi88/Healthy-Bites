## Design

### Colours

For Healthy Bites, I opted for a light color palette that embodies the joy and vitality associated with wholesome eating. The intention was to craft a visual environment that exudes both happiness and health. In particular, the green text was chosen to symbolize organic, farm-fresh produce, echoing the shades of verdant leaves and the essence of nature.

This color scheme perfectly resonates with the core values of Healthy Bites, emphasizing the importance of natural, nutritious choices.

<details><summary>Colour pallet</summary>

![Colour pallet](docs/colour_pallete.jpg)

</details>

### Fonts

 For Healthy Bites, I chose the 'Open Sans' font due to its clean and modern aesthetics, aligning perfectly with our fresh and health-conscious brand image. For branding elements, we utilized the 'Zilla Slab' font, offering a distinct contrast. As a fallback, the sans-serif and serif fonts ensure consistent readability across different platforms

### Structure

#### Website pages

Aiming for an intuitive and user-friendly experience, Healthy Bites' website layout is designed with familiarity in mind. This includes a navigation bar situated at the top of all pages, ensuring easy access to all features. Furthermore, for optimal mobile viewing, a hamburger menu icon is incorporated for smaller screens, promoting seamless navigation regardless of device size.

The footer is designed to bridge the online gap between Healthy Bites and our patrons. It showcases relevant social media icons, inviting users to connect with our brand on various platforms. By doing so, we aim to foster a sense of community, boost our digital presence, and share the joys of healthy living with a broader audience.

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| Navigation bar disappearing on mobile view | CSS media query was missing for mobile breakpoints. Added the appropriate media query to ensure visibility. |
| Unable to scroll through the list of smoothies | Overflow property was mistakenly set to 'hidden'. Changed it to 'scroll' for smoothie section. |
| 'Contact Us' form not sending messages | Server-side script handling form submissions was missing. Integrated the form with a server-side handler to process messages. |
| Duplicate items appearing in the 'Desserts' section | Database query was fetching items twice due to a loop error. Corrected the loop to fetch each item only once. |
| Error when adding new milkshakes in user favorites | A mismatched data type in the database. Corrected the data type to ensure users can add milkshakes to favorites without issues. |

## Credits

### Images

For the visuals on Healthy Bites, I sourced images from Unsplash, ensuring I only utilized the free ones available to avoid any licensing issues.

### Code

When building Healthy Bites, I extensively used Bootstrap. It was my first deep dive into using it, and I must say, I've become quite fond of it. The responsiveness and design elements it offers made the development process smoother and more efficient.

I greatly benefited from the Django tutorials on Code Institute. Additionally, several blog posts and GitHub repositories were instrumental in my learning. Key GitHub pages that were particularly helpful include:

- [Restaurant System With Python and Django](https://github.com/younesaitmha/restaurant-System-With-Python-and-Django)
- [Online Restaurant Web App](https://github.com/hmisonne/OnlineRestaurantWebApp)
- [Booking Example](https://github.com/andreagrandi/booking-example)


## Acknowledgements

First and foremost, my heartfelt gratitude goes to my wife, Filsan. Her unwavering patience, support, and understanding have been the backbone of this project. Balancing time between our young ones and this project was made feasible due to her continuous encouragement.

I'd also like to extend a special thank you to my mentor, Mo Shami. His expertise, constructive feedback, and continuous guidance have been instrumental in shaping this project to what it is today.
