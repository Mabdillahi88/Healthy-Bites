## Design

### Colours

For Healthy Bites, I opted for a light color palette that embodies the joy and vitality associated with wholesome eating. The intention was to craft a visual environment that exudes both happiness and health. In particular, the green text was chosen to symbolize organic, farm-fresh produce, echoing the shades of verdant leaves and the essence of nature.

This color scheme perfectly resonates with the core values of Healthy Bites, emphasizing the importance of natural, nutritious choices.

<details><summary>Colour pallet</summary>

![Colour pallet](docs/colour_pallete.jpg)

</details>

### Fonts

 For Healthy Bites, I chose the 'Open Sans' font due to its clean and modern aesthetics, aligning perfectly with our fresh and health-conscious brand image. For branding elements, we utilized the 'Zilla Slab' font, offering a distinct contrast. As a fallback, the sans-serif and serif fonts ensure consistent readability across different platforms

### Structure

#### Website pages

Aiming for an intuitive and user-friendly experience, Healthy Bites' website layout is designed with familiarity in mind. This includes a navigation bar situated at the top of all pages, ensuring easy access to all features. Furthermore, for optimal mobile viewing, a hamburger menu icon is incorporated for smaller screens, promoting seamless navigation regardless of device size.

The footer is designed to bridge the online gap between Healthy Bites and our patrons. It showcases relevant social media icons, inviting users to connect with our brand on various platforms. By doing so, we aim to foster a sense of community, boost our digital presence, and share the joys of healthy living with a broader audience.
